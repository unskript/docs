# For DevOps

One of the core principles of DevOps is empowering teams to work collaboratively.&#x20;

**With unSkript:**

* All your RunBooks and Actions are in one place for easy collaboration, sharing, and updating.
* &#x20;With Role Based Access Control -give teams run access only to resolve issues.
* For sensitive RunBooks - require an approval before the RunBook can be processed.
* Schedule RunBooks for regular tasks.
* Connect the same RunBook to multiple environments - dev, staging and production using ServiceIds.  No issues with version control in different environments.
* RunBooks can be completely automated, or run interactively in a step-by-step process.



### RunBooks to:

* Automate away repetitive tasks.&#x20;
* Run Healthchecks on your infrastructure
* Security checks
* Manage costs
* and more

**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!
