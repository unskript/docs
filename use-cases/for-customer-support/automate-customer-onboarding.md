# Automate Customer Onboarding



Engineers and operations teams often have scripts that they run for customer success teams for tasks such as&#x20;

* customer onboarding
* deletion of compliance data
* refresh customer trials
* add new users or admins for customers
* run reports

unSkript allows engineering teams to turn such scripts and one-liners into xRunBooks that can be run directly by the customer success teams.
