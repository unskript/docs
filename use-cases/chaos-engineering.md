# Chaos Engineering

Chaos engineering is a method of testing distributed software that deliberately introduces failure and faulty scenarios to verify its resilience in the face of random disruptions. These disruptions can cause apps and infrastructure to respond unpredictably and break under pressure.





"[I have so much chaos in my life, it's become normal. You become used to it. You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how they're wrong." - Tom Welling](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]



RunBook Automation from unSkript can be your 'go-to' tool to resolve issues when they occur, but also to build preventative automations so that the issue seen in your chaos testing will never occur again. &#x20;



Chaos testing finds the issues: RunBook Automation is the resolution.
