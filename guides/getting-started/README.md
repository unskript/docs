# Getting started

Automating your CloudOps toil has never been easier. With unSkript's prebuilt [Actions](../actions/) and [RunBooks](../../lists/xRunBook\_list.md), you can be automating in minutes.

1. [Install or sign up](sign-up-install.md).  What's the difference?
   1. Our Docker container is open source and free to install
   2. Our SaaS [Free Trial](https://us.app.unskript.io/) is 100% free, but hosted in the cloud.
2. Try a prebuilt [RunBook](../../lists/xRunBook\_list.md). &#x20;
   1. Each RunBook has [input parameters](../xrunbooks/create-a-parameter.md).
   2. RunBooks are made of [Actions](../actions/) that perform a basic task.
      1. Each Action requires a [credential](../xrunbooks/create-a-credential.md) to authenticate to a service. They also have [input parameters](../actions/action-configuration/configure-action-inputs.md) that must be added to complete the action.  These can be hardcoded, or variables from previous Actions.&#x20;
   3. Once the Parameters and Credentials are added to the RunBook, it is ready to go!
3. Questions?  Join our [Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-ops-community/awesome-cloud-automation)!
4. Create new RunBooks or Actions.
   1. Share your work with a PR in our [Awesome-CloudOps-Automation](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation).  Show your appreciation by giving the repo a ⭐️ star!
