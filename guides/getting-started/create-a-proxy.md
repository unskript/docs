# Create a Proxy

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: There is no concept of a Proxy in the [open source version](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation) of unSkript, as it is assumed that your install will be behind your firewall.
{% endhint %}

unSkript needs a dedicated runtime environment where xRunBook workflows can be securely executed. This can be either on the unSkript SAAS side, or in your cloud (behind your cloud firewalls).

We currently offer the ability to install proxies in your:

* [AWS Cloud](../../connnecting/proxies/aws-proxy.md)
* [GCP Cloud](../../connnecting/proxies/gcp-proxy.md)
* [Private Cloud](../../connnecting/proxies/#private-cloud)
* [onPrem](../../connnecting/proxies/#on-premises)
* [unSkript Hosted](../../connnecting/proxies/unskript-proxy.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Free Trial only allows for one unSkript Hosted Proxy. &#x20;
