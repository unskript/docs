# Prebuilt xRunBooks

## AWS

* [AWS Access Key Rotation for IAM users](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS\_Access\_Key\_Rotation.ipynb): This runbook can be used to configure AWS Access Key rotation. Changing access keys (which consist of an access key ID and a secret access key) on a regular schedule is a well-known security best practice because it shortens the period an access key is active and therefore reduces the business impact if they are compromised. Having an established process that is run regularly also ensures the operational steps around key rotation are verified, so changing a key is never a scary step.
* [AWS Add Mandatory tags to EC2](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/AWS\_Add\_Mandatory\_tags\_to\_EC2.ipynb): This xRunBook is a set of example actions that could be used to establish mandatory tagging to EC2 instances. First testing instances for compliance, and creating reports of instances that are missing the required tags. There is also and action to add tags to an instance - to help bring them into tag compliance.
* [Create a new AWS IAM User](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Add\_new\_IAM\_user.ipynb): AWS has an inbuilt identity and access management system known as AWS IAM. IAM supports the concept of users, group, roles and privileges. IAM user is an identity that can be created and assigned some privileges. This runbook can be used to create an AWS IAM User
* [Change AWS EBS Volume To GP3 Type](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Change\_EBS\_Volume\_To\_GP3\_Type.ipynb): This runbook can be used to change the type of an EBS volume to GP3(General Purpose 3). GP3 type volume has a number of advantages over it's predecessors. gp3 volumes are ideal for a wide variety of applications that require high performance at low cost
* [Change AWS Route53 TTL](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Change\_Route53\_TTL.ipynb): For a record in a hosted zone, lower TTL means that more queries arrive at the name servers because the cached values expire sooner. If you configure a higher TTL for your records, then the intermediate resolvers cache the records for longer time. As a result, there are fewer queries received by the name servers. This configuration reduces the charges corresponding to the DNS queries answered. However, higher TTL slows the propagation of record changes because the previous values are cached for longer periods. This Runbook can be used to configure a higher value of a TTL .
* [Configure URL endpoint on a AWS CloudWatch alarm](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Configure\_url\_endpoint\_on\_a\_cloudwatch\_alarm.ipynb): Configures the URL endpoint to the SNS associated with a CloudWatch alarm. This allows to external functions to be invoked within unSkript in response to an alert getting generated. Alarms can be attached to the handlers to perform data enrichment or remediation

* [Delete EBS Volume Attached to Stopped Instances](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Delete\_EBS\_Volumes\_Attached\_To\_Stopped\_Instances.ipynb): EBS (Elastic Block Storage) volumes are attached to EC2 Instances as storage devices. Unused (Unattached) EBS Volumes can keep accruing costs even when their associated EC2 instances are no longer running. These volumes need to be deleted if the instances they are attached to are no more required. This runbook helps us find such volumes and delete them.
* [Delete EBS Volume With Low Usage](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Delete\_EBS\_Volumes\_With\_Low\_Usage.ipynb): This runbook can help us identify low usage Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes and delete these volumes in order to lower the cost of your AWS bill. This is calculates using the VolumeUsage metric. It measures the percentage of the total storage space that is currently being used by an EBS volume. This metric is reported as a percentage value between 0 and 100.
* [Delete Old EBS Snapshots](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Delete\_Old\_EBS\_Snapshots.ipynb): Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots are created incrementally, an initial snapshot will include all the data on the disk, and subsequent snapshots will only store the blocks on the volume that have changed since the prior snapshot. Unchanged data is not stored, but referenced using the previous snapshot. This runbook helps us to find old EBS snapshots and thereby lower storage costs.
* [Delete Unattached AWS EBS Volumes](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Delete\_Unattached\_EBS\_Volume.ipynb): This runbook can be used to delete all unattached EBS Volumes within an AWS region. You can delete an Amazon EBS volume that you no longer need. After deletion, its data is gone and the volume can't be attached to any instance. So before deletion, you can store a snapshot of the volume, which you can use to re-create the volume later.
* [Delete Unused AWS Log Streams](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/blob/master/AWS/AWS\_Delete\_Unused\_Log\_Streams.ipynb): Cloudwatch will retain empty Log Streams after the data retention time period. Those log streams should be deleted in order to save costs. This runbook can find unused log streams over a threshold number of days and help you delete them.
* [Delete Unused AWS NAT Gateways](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Delete\_Unused\_AWS\_NAT\_Gateways.ipynb): This runbook can be used to identify and remove any unused NAT Gateways. This allows us to adhere to best practices and avoid unnecessary costs. NAT gateways are used to connect a private instance with outside networks. When a NAT gateway is provisioned, AWS charges you based on the number of hours it was available and the data (GB) it processes.

You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the Service state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
* [Detach EC2 Instance from ASG and Load balancer](https://github.com/unskript/Awesome-CloudOps-Automation/tree/master/AWS/Detach\_ec2\_Instance\_from\_ASG.ipynb): This runbook can be used to detach an instance from Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer. You can remove (detach) an instance that is in the InService state from an Auto Scaling group. After the instance is detached, you can manage it independently from the rest of the Auto Scaling group. By detaching an instance, you can move an instance out of one Auto Scaling group and attach it to a different group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.

Web encryption protocols like SSL and TLS have been around for nearly three decades. By securing web data in transit, these security measures ensure that third parties canâ€™t simply intercept unencrypted data and cause harm. HTTPS uses the underlying SSL/TLS technology and is the standard way to communicate web data in an encrypted and authenticated manner instead of using insecure HTTP protocol. In this runbook, we implement the industry best practice of redirecting all unencrypted HTTP data to the secure HTTPS protocol.
