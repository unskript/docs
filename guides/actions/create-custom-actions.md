While unSkript offers many Actions for your xRunBooks, it's probable that you'll want to create your own, or perhaps modify an existing Action for your specific needs.

For this, you can create a custom Action.

You can modify the source code of a built-in Action to create your custom action.&#x20;

Here is an example which uses the built-in Get boto3 handle Action which is modified to fetch all EC2 instances for that region.

The custom action can be renamed and saved as a new Action to fit your Task.&#x20;

Fill out the details to save the new Action.

You can view all your Custom Actions in the Actions tab under myActions.
