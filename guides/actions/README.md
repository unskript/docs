# Actions

## [Prebuilt Action List](broken-reference)

These Actions are open source and ready to be integrated into your RunBooks.

## [Custom Actions](create-custom-actions.md)

Create your own Actions! &#x20;

* Edit an existing Action to customize the output to your exact needs.
* Create a small Python Script to manipulate the data you already have collected

Here's an example Action where the existing data is charted using matplotlib:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
