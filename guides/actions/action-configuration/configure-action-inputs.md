# Configure Action Inputs

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7id_TS9EK_c" %}



Most Actions take Input parameters. This makes them flexible and reusable.  Each Input parameter has a type (List, String, Number, etc.) to ensur ethatthe correct data is being sent into the Action.

You can set the value right in the right navigation:

`"us-west-2"`

Or, we could assign a variable to the value "us-west-2" and then apply that variable as the input.
