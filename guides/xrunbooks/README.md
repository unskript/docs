# Creating RunBooks

RunBooks are at the heart of unSkript.  RunBooks outline a stepwise process that can be run either interactively or automatically.  Learn how to use and create RunBooks!



A RunBook is a sequence of Actions put together to form a multi-step workflow. A given step in the xRunBook may be executed individually and interactively providing a Human-in-loop interface.

unSkript offers pre-built RunBooks that allow you to begin automation immediately.  With these RunBooks, you can get started quickly by just adding your [cloud credentials](../connectors/), and the RunBook [input parameters](create-a-parameter.md).&#x20;

This is a great way to learn how unSkript works, but everyone's cloud is different, and you'll soon want to customize and create your own RunBooks.
