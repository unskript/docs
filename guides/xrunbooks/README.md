# xRunBooks

A xRunBook is a sequence of Actions put together to form a multi-step workflow. A given step in the xRunBook may be executed individually and interactively providing a Human-in-loop interface.

unSkript offers pre-built RunBooks that allow you to begin automation immediately.  With these RunBooks, you'll need to add input parameters for the RunBook, and credentials for each Action, and you'll be ready to go!
