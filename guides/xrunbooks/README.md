# xRunBooks

A xRunBook is a sequence of Actions put together to form a multi-step workflow. A given step in the xRunBook may be executed individually and interactively providing a Human-in-loop interface.

Start by visiting the xRunBooks tab and click the Create button.

Fill in the required information and you will be dropped into the xRunBook details page.  This page will be a lot more useful once you've created the xRunBook.
