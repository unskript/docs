# Running XRunBooks

Click Close to save the contents (unSkript saves automatically as well!) of the xRunBook. You will be dropped into the xRunBook listing page. From here you can run the xRunBook you created interactively or non-interactively. Choose the mode you want to start the execution.

This creates an execution of the xRunBook which will then prompt for the parameters to be used along with the environment(s) in which it has to execute.&#x20;

You can enable/disable environment selection by clicking on the xRunBook details page (xRunBook ->Open Details)

Once the parameter values are filled in, an execution will be triggered and the user will be notified.
