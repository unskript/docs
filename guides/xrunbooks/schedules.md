# Schedules

Any xRunBook can be scheduled to run on a cadence. To configure the schedule, click the Events link on the top nav bar. This will take you to the page where the execution schedule can be configured.

The schedule is configured in a [cron](https://crontab.guru/) like fashion, with a helpful text display about the schedule in words and the next execution time. On clicking Apply, the system will ask for xRunBook parameters if any were configured.&#x20;

Once the parameter values have been provided, the schedule is created and the xRunBook will be run according to the configuration.
