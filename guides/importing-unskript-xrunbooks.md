# Importing unSkript xRunBooks

The [unSkript GitHub repository](../open-source/cloudops-automation-with-unskript.md) has many xRunBooks that are open source and available for your use.

Here is [another listing of all of our xRunBooks](../lists/xRunBook\_list.md).

{% tab title="Open Source" %}
All of the pre-configured xRunBooks are shown on the Welcome.ipynb.  Simply click the link, and the xRunBook will open in a new tab for editing.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sandbox/SAAS" %}
Importing xRunBooks is identical in the free sandbox and in our SAAS offering.





* Navigate to the xRunBooks tab.&#x20;
* Click the unSkript xRunBooks tab for a listing of available xRunBooks.
* Sort them using the tags, or search for a sepcific keyword.  Once you find a xRunBook you'd like to use, click the three dots to the right of the row.  Click `Import xRunBook`.
* You'll be prompted to name your version of the xRunBook, and assign a proxy.  This will import the xRunBook into your workspace for editing. &#x20;
* You can now edit the [Actions](actions/action-configuration/), [Parameters](xrunbooks/create-a-parameter.md) so modify the xRunBook to exactly your needs.
