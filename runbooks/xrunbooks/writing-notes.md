# Writing Notes

unSkript is built on top of Jupyter notebooks, so all xRunBooks have the capability to be appended with markdown formatted notes. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not familiar with markdown, here's a great [`guide`](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Or just use text.  It's all good.
{% endhint %}

Use the **Add Action** drop down to select **Add Notes** Option. This will open a new note in edit mode. Use markdown syntax to jot down your notes.

### Best Practices

* Add a Note field at the top of the xRunBook describing the purpose of the xRunBook and how it works.  List all the parameters that the xRunBook requires, and how they are used
* Comment on each Action on how it works. A sample output helps others understand what data is coming from each Action.
* Conclude with a description of the output. Including a sample output is also quite beneficial
