# Role Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to your workflows and connections based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

This enables granularity and security for the workflows which restricts user movement across the platform.

There are 5 main roles that can be assigned to a user on the unSkript platform-

1. Viewer
2. Executor
3. Editor
4. Approver
5. Requestor

To enable RBAC for your workflows click on the More tab and select User Management
