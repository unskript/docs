# Folders

Folders can be used to organize RunBooks.  Folders are also used for [Role Based Access Control](../../guides/role-based-access-control/) -where all permissions are based at the folder level.

## Create a Folder

To create a Folder, navigate to the xRunBooks tab and click on the Create button, pick Folder, and give your new Folder a name.

Here is an example of an Incident Response folder which contains two xRunBooks. &#x20;

Since these RunBooks are in the same folder, we can apply [RBAC](../../guides/role-based-access-control/) controls that limit which team members can run or edit the RunBooks.  We could also require that some users "request access" to run these Runbooks.
