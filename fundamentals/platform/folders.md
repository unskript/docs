# Folders

Folders can be used to organize RunBooks as per business needs. unSkript allows users to create Folders to organize multiple xRunBooks for a particular workflow.  Folders are also used for [Role Based Access Control](../../guides/role-based-access-control/) -where all permissions are based at the folder level.



To create a Folder, navigate to the xRunBooks tab and click on the Create button.

Here is an example of an Incident Response folder which contains two xRunBooks to restart unhealthy instances in a Target Group and then duplicate unhealthy instances without the credentials. Each of the xRunBook has multiple actions which are configured to create a workflow.
