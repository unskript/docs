An environment in unSkript is a collection of all the resources that your workload uses to function.&#x20;

unSkript Cloud supports multiple environments in a single proxy instance. For example, you might have a development, staging and production environments (with different credentials) inside the same proxy.

inside each Environment, you might have:

* Databases
* Infrastructure & Orchestration
* Services (REST APIs)
* CI/CD Tools
* Observability (Metrics, Logs)

Additionally, we also connect to collaboration tools (Jira, Slack etc.) to provide a seamless experience both on and off the platform.
