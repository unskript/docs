# Running HealthChecks

From the HealthCheck page, Click the "Run Checks" button in the top menu.\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (2).png>)

New boxes showing that the Checks are in Progress will appear:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (2).png>)

Once the Checks have completed running, each check will have a status:

* Passed: No action needed.
* ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (2).png>)
* Failed: There is an issue.
* ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png>)

If a check has failed, you will want to remediate the Check. Each failed Action has a "Click here to Fix" button.  Learn how to [remediate a Check](healthcheck-remediation.md).
