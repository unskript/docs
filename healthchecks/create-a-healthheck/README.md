# Create a Healthheck

A step by step guide to creating a Healthcheck.

2. A group of checks is called a Suite.  To create a HealthCheck Suite, click the "**+ Create Suite**" button. You'll be prompted to name your Suite.

4. When Opening your new HealthCheck, you'll be asked to connect to an [Environment](../../connnecting/proxies/connect-your-environment/).  Environments are your list of credentials.  The HealthCheck will use the default ServiceID for that environment.![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)
5.  After selecting your Proxy and Environment, a page for your HealthCheck Suite is created.
