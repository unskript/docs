# Create a HealthCheck Folder

Inside your HealthCheck Suite, the Checks are stored in Folders.  In this section, we'll create a folder, and add checks to the folder.

Folders are a way to group checks.  Currently, the fodler types are limited by the connector.  So you can have an AWS folder with AWS healthchecks, Postgres with Postgres, etc.

1. Add folder.  Inside the Suite, there is a "+ Add Folder" button.  Click this button to begin the process.
2. Name your Folder and choose the connectivity for the folder. Click "Add Folder."![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)
3. Your new Folder will appear on the screen.![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)



You can now add additional folders to the HealthCheck Suite, or begin adding Checks.

## Remove a Folder

Healthcheck folders can be removed by placing the cursor over the folder's icon.  A trash can icon will appear.  Clicking this (and confirming) will delete the folder.
